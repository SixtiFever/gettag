## Option 1 (Process-Focused):
"Record a 6-second video, tag a friend, and watch your creation grow. Each tagged user adds their own 6-second contribution, building collaborative videos where individual creativity becomes collective storytelling."

## Option 2 (More Inspirational):
"Start with your 6-second vision, tag a friend to continue the story. Each new contributor adds their unique perspective, creating unexpected, collaborative masterpieces that showcase the power of creative teamwork."

## Option 3 (Action-Oriented):
"Create, tag, collaborate. Record your 6-second video, tag another creator, and watch as your individual contribution transforms into a collaborative narrative built through creative teamwork and shared imagination."

## Option 4 (Emphasizing the Chain):
"A creative chain reaction: record your 6-second video, tag the next creator, and watch as individual contributions link together into unique, collaborative stories that no single person could have imagined."
